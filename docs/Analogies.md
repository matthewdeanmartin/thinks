# Github's current social features

Not all of Github's current social features make sense for a twitter replacement.

- Issues = Blog. I don't know if there natively is an RSS feed for Issues.
- Wiki = Wiki. I'm not sure how collaborative 
- Account follows [mattthewdeanmartin](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin) - this is very much about following things like repo creation. 
- Watch this repo [watch](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/thinks)- This is very much for software release type things.
- Star this repo [watch](https://github.com/matthewdeanmartin/thinks)- This is just to aid account discovery.
- Your Github notification feed now plays some of the role of the twitter newsfeed, but it will not have the stream of commits from all the `thinks` repos you follow
